[Amazon Web Services Certification]: <https://www.netcomlearning.com/vendors/aws-training.phtml?advid=1356>

At least if you’re an IT worker who works with cloud computing, the quick answer is straightforward. Yes.

You don’t want to believe me? Fortunately, you don’t have to — it’s all in the statistics. Amazon controls 33% of the cloud computing industry, three times higher than the next most prominent rival, Microsoft (11 percent ). Furthermore, AWS is now experiencing year-on-year growth of 43 percent, implying that they are likely to not only maintain but even increase their market share in the future.
Numbers provide one side of the story, but what about in the real world?

##The Advantages of AWS Certification So, why should you strive for some AWS certification? There are several causes for this, but three stick out.

### 1. It is a symbol of high quality.
AWS certifications help showcase AWS competence to our customers. It acts as a gold standard and helps to retain confidence with clients while keeping up with AWS developments. Personally, passing the Professional Certified Solutions Architect test became a “badge” of my grasp of AWS cloud architecture, opening the door to more profound cloud talks with AWS and clients.
AWS certification programs do give a fantastic route for self-improvement that is recognized, so as an individual, it will always be important.

### 2. You will make more money.
This year, a poll showed some pretty astounding figures about the influence of an AWS certification on pay. According to a survey of it workers and managers in the United States and Canada, an AWS cloud technology certificate was found to increase the wages of IT employees and managers by an astonishing 25.9 percent. Certified respondents earned an average of US$113,932 per year, while uncertified respondents earned an average of US$90,512.

###3. AWS represents the past, present, and future.
AWS — and Amazon as a whole — aren’t exactly moving backward. In reality, it is on a collision course with absolute dominion. As far as anybody can tell, AWS’s dominance in the cloud computing sector will only grow in the future, and obtaining access to the work that this monopolization will create is made considerably more straightforward if you can demonstrate your credentials.
In summary, an AWS certification will enable you to acquire more employment with higher income for many years to come.
